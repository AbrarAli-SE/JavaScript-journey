# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository where I track my progress and projects as I learn JavaScript. This repository serves as both a personal diary and a showcase of my growth in coding with JavaScript.

In this repository, you will find various folders and files documenting my journey:
- **Practice Codes**: Daily exercises and small snippets of code that help me understand the fundamentals of JavaScript.
- **Projects**: Larger, more complex projects that integrate various JavaScript concepts and possibly other technologies.

## Objectives
The main goals of this repository are:
- To document my learning progress in JavaScript.
